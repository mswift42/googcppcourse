// Exercise 1
// The integer 36 has a peculiar property: it is a perfect square, and is
// also the sum of the integers from 1 through 8. The next such number is
// 1225 which is 352, and the sum of the integers from 1 through 49. Find
// the next number that is a perfect square and also the sum of a series
// 1...n. This next number may be greater than 32767. You may use library
// functions that you know of, (or mathematical formulas) to make your
// program run faster. It is also possible to write this program using
// for-loops to determine if a number is a perfect square or a sum of a
// series. (Note: depending on your machine and your program, it can take
// quite a while to find this number.)
